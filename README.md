Haskell plugin for LightTable
===

Currently it supports:
* Hoogling via `ctrl-shift-d` and selecting hsh (default)
* Hayooing via `ctrl-shift-d` and selecting hsy
* Hayooing inline via `ctrl-d`
* Stylish haskell via sidebar "Haskell: Reformat file"
* Syntax checking via sidebar "Haskell: Check syntax"
* Linting via sidebar "Haskell: Check lint"

Working on:
* ghc-mod features
* Running a simple haskell file


Requirements
===

A recent version of `cabal` that supports `cabal sandbox` and `cabal run`. This must be on a load path that LightTable can read.

This plugin is in the early stages, and can use any kind of help. The best place to start is the issues. I've marked things as `easy` that should be, well, easy. Feel free to comment on any issue asking for help/direction.
